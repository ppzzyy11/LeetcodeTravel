# Total
    previous 1000 problems in Leetcode-CN, there are 540-7=533 middle problems, 211 hard problems.
    533+221=754
    533 * 15 = 7995 minutes
    221 * 30 = 6630 minutes
    7795+6630=14625 minutes = 243.75 hours = 5.08 weeks

However, if we spent 8 hours on weekdays and 4 hours each weekends, summing up to 48 hours each week, there is only 6.25 weeks before we complete our plan.

Apart from that, we need spend 30 minutes each day to practice speaking English.
