548 cut branches to reduce time complexity
    There are three pointers, so the TC must be O(N^3):
    1. We can three pointers are too many, fix the middle pointer and cut branches;
    2. Create middle level data.
      travel two times with TC O(N^2). The first travel find N temporary results/pairs;
    3. Fix one pointer, and use two pointers to find all sulution. O(N^2);

    Instead of brute force, we binarily search the result and verify whther the result is valid.

In some dynamic problems, map as dp can save space than matrix, because not all grid will be used
