548 cut branches to reduce time complexity
    There are three pointers, so the TC must be O(N^3):
    1. We can three pointers are too many, fix the middle pointer and cut branches;
    2. Create middle level data.
      travel two times with TC O(N^2). The first travel find N temporary results/pairs;
    3. Fix one pointer, and use two pointers to find all sulution. O(N^2);

    Instead of brute force, we binarily search the result and verify whther the result is valid.

In some dynamic problems, map as dp can save space than matrix, because not all grid will be used

subarraty sum -> prefix sum

panlinrome -> panlinrome matrix, after a O(N^2), we can determine whther a substring is a palindrome in O(1)

DP state -> tansform

opposite

Hard problems are combinations of middlle and general problems.


"minimize the maximum" or "maximize the minimum" leads to binary search. After determine the upper and lower bound of the target value, it is a must that we find a linear way to verify our possible value.
