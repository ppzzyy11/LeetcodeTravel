548 cut branches to reduce time complexity
    There are three pointers, so the TC must be O(N^3):
    1. We can three pointers are too many, fix the middle pointer and cut branches;
    2. travel two times with TC O(N^2). The first travel find N temporary results/pairs;
    3. Fix one pointer, and use two pointers to find all sulution. O(N^2);
